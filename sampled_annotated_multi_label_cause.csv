1,How do you get the courage to speak out : Just gone over 4 years of depression. I say that like I have been diagnosed but I am yet to go seek help. So I guess let me rephrase it as 4 years of an internal struggle. It’s started way back in late 2015 when I started to feel this kinda change in me like nothing or no one interested me anymore. I am aware I should seek the necessary help but my life is just a little too complicated for that. For starters there is my family I cannot begin to imagine how I would even start a conversation about this. Then there is my mum who is just my world. She is a deeply pious women and I recall a vivid conversation we had about mental illness and do you know what she told me she said there is no where in the holy book ( I won’t say which cause it’s not that important) that has anything on mental illness you tilt only 2 ways you’re crazy or you’re stressed. I remember feeling unsettled by this as I try to understand her but ultimately it broke my heart because I came to the realisation she could never understand the complexity of mental illness. So I stayed quite for years and I guess I have been staying quite ever since and buried it within me. But I am currently feeling the worst I have ever felt in my life and I don’t know I don’t want to feel alone anymore. Sorry for waffling but I wanted to ask how does someone blurt this out??,0,0,1,0,0
2,"My problems started after my first panic attack which had happened in October. After that I had a lot of anxiety about my heart (bp 140/90) I was medicated with Zoloft for a while, it helped but I didn't want to become dependent on it and I had a lot of side effects. My bp with Zoloft was around 120/70 After some weeks the anxiety came back with horror, fear of the death and lump in a neck, stiffness in chest.

I don't have any particular skills, besides almost never getting fatigued, the ability to walk for hours on end without getting tired, lifting some pretty heavy objects despite my skinny figure, and a few other things.

The only things of value that I have anymore are my phone and laptop that I've had since I ran away, and I mainly use the wifi at work to access the internet.

5,"I was brutally raped for 2 months. By my best friends boyfriend. My best friend died of cancer. A month later her boyfriend messaged me saying he just needed a friend. I went over that night to his place. I regret ever doing that. He drugged and raped me. The next morning he threatened me. Told me if I didn't keep giving him what he wanted he would kill me and himself. I was terrified. 

For 2 months every day I let him bias and rape me. Out of fear. I eventually started to get myself so drunk I'd just pass out. 

I'd wake up bloody and bruised. He'd wake up ready to do it all over again. 

I'm now so fucked in the head from this experience I find myself missing him. I hate these thoughts. They never go away. I don't want to think this way anymore. I've tried everything. Nothing works.

And I'm completely alone in this state. So I had to call someone to come out and jump me. But it wouldn't jump. So I had to spend money to get it towed. Then the damn mechanic shop jerked me around, and ended up fighting with them alot ( I use to be a mechanic so I know when I'm getting jerked around) but they were so incompetent, that it took them 6 hours to basically figure out that the battery needed to be replaced and then do it. They lied to me when they told me the tested the battery when they first pulled it in the bay. They put a new starter on, without telling me until after the fact. And then told me my engine was seized up due to there being 0 oil in it. Which I dont know if I believe, because I just got my oil changed about a week and a half ago. And I know I dont have a leak. So either they were lying or the technician at the luge shop didnt put oil back in my car. But anyway, long story short. They forced me to pay 600$ for basically a battery change. And then I had to go back to work 2 hours later, with no sleep since my last shift. So that was great. But that 600$ was going to be for my rent. No I dont have any money.

58,"I have a low IQ. Twice I've been tested and both times I got an IQ around 84-85. Somehow, I didn't do entirely awful in school, I was able to be a B student without much studying. When I actually started studying I started to get grades in the 90s and even some at 100%. Even though I skimmed through with exemplary grades, I barely retained any of what I learned. Nobody around me believes that I am stupid because of my grades, but that is all they go off of. I have a poor vocabulary overall, especially in spoken word, and I cannot do basic mental math. I still count with my fingers and I am nineteen years old. I am from a low income, uneducated family so I was innately disadvantaged from birth, also with having my mom smoke weed and cigarettes throughout her pregnancy with me. During the 8th month of her pregnancy I detached from the placenta and they had to preform an emergency c-section. It is very likely that I have brain damage from oxygen deprivation. 

I just feel incredibly empty every moment I am awake. My favorite time of the day is when I go to sleep at night, but night always goes by too quickly.

It is unbearable being aware every moment that I am dumb and will only ever be dumb. I have always aspired to leave the financial hole, but everyday that passes reminds me that it will probably never happen.

85,"Why am I like this ? : There is a deep feeling of sadness that seems to possess my mind and body every now and again. I have this one vivid memory from when I was about 7 years old. I lived with both of my parent in an old apartment on the third floor. I sat on the arm rest of the couch in my living room and stared out the window at rickety old cars passing on the street, at the corner of my eye I spotted an old man smoking a cigarette. He had dirty grey jeans, a black shirt with holes, and shoulder length hair tucked into a winter hat. It had to have been about 80 degrees on a hot summer day. Thinking back on this he could have very well just been a hipster, but let’s just go with my 7 year old perspective and say he was indeed homeless. As I watched him slowly walk by I imagined myself leaving my body and seeing life through his eyes. The longer I stared the stronger it became, I imagined the feeling of every step he took on the hot cement and the smell of burning tobacco, I felt the confusion and desperation he must have felt every night while he searched for a safe place to sleep. I began to break down into tears and feel ashamed for having a place to sleep, and food in my refrigerator. I felt as though I didn’t deserve the things that I had because others were more deserving. I remember not eating for the rest of the day because I felt so guilty for just being alive, which is absolutely ridiculous at the age of SEVEN. I still have these feelings a few times a week, they’re so strong and take control of my mind. They make me feel weak and tired. I feel undeserving and invisible most days. I’ve given away money and belongings. I’ve even gone so far as to let people use me emotionally and sexually just to make them happy. This story escalated quickly.

I made serval attempts since I was 16, never really trying hard enough. But tonight I really really really wanted to do it. I tried cutting myself but the knife I got wasn't sharp enough... my boyfriend ended up calling me in the middle of everything. So I talked to him about it, I was on hold with the suicide hotline anyways.

I guess I didn't REALLY want to otherwise it would've worked? I've always heard of people just cutting, but it ends up going too deep and that's how they almost die. Don't know why I'm writing this.. actually I do I want to hear from someone. Encouragement, your story, anything.

It started on the NYE with my puppy almost dying from the fireworks. He literally shat all over myself. In may I had my first terrible depression and anxiety crisis and had to be away from my internship for 2 weeks. Then in June I went through the first real loss of my life. My dear uncle died from a heart attack al of sudden. Even though all of this, I got promoted on my job. It was a complicated time dealing with new responsibilities and grief. I fell on depression again and this time was worse  I literally wanted to die. Even hurted myself. This made me get away from work again but now for 2 months. I had great support from family and the company I work for, but it was hard to get back on my feet again. During all of these I had to leave university for the year as I couldn't deal with the pression at the time.

My parents don't even believe that I studied for the tests I had E's in (in Germany the grades are from 1-6 instead of from A-F, but for some reason E doesn't exist, so with E I mean the grade 5) because they ""KNOW"" I can do much better since they know me from my childhood.

But I have the feeling that part of me is dead. I am not the highly intelligent happy boy you could always count on, now I am just an irresponsible failure. I feel useless. I hate myself.
I told my father I wanted to go to therapy after he asked me why I am doing so bad lately, I haven't told him anything about my self-hate. 
He said that they will always love and support me and that we will solve this problem together and hugged me.

I started crying. I couldn't stop crying. I felt like the worst human on earth. I felt like I didn't deserve help or support after these things I've done, like forging my parents' signatures because I was too much of a coward to tell them about my bad grades. I felt like I didn't deserve having parents that love me. I felt like I didn't deserve to live a happy life. 
But I could also never commit suicide or anything because that would make everyone who, for a reason I don't understand, belives in me, like my friends, family, and even my doctor who told my parents: ""This kid of yours is going places! I am so excited to see what he will have achieved in 10 years!"" sad. I don't want them to be sad. That would just be egoistic of me.
